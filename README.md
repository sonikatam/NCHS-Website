# NCHS-Website

This project was developed for my **FBLA Coding and Programming** competition. The website is fully built using **HTML** and **CSS** and serves as a demonstration of front-end web development skills.

## Overview
The NCHS-Website is a static, responsive website showcasing the use of **HTML** for structure and **CSS** for styling. It is designed to meet competition requirements, with an emphasis on clean, organized code and a user-friendly interface.

## How to Run
1. Clone or download the repository to your local machine.
2. Open the `index.html` file in any modern web browser to view the website.
   
   Alternatively, you can use a local server like **Live Server** (VS Code extension) for a more seamless experience.
  
Feel free to explore the structure, design elements, and styling decisions throughout the project!
